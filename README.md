# Writing sample: Setting up static sites with GitLab and Netlify CLI 

This brief tutorial explains how developers can use GitLab and Netlify's CLI tool to deploy a static site. The tutorial is intended for anyone with basic knowledge of Git, npm, CI/CD, and the command line. 

## Why I wrote this tutorial

I had some issues with deploying a static site through the Netlify UI, so I had to learn how to deploy my site through their CLI tool. I decided to write this tutorial to help other developers who wanted to use Netlify's CLI tool, too. 

## Tools I used

* Markdown
* Visual Studio Code
* GitLab
* Netlify CLI
